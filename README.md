# browserstack-webdriver

Selenium is a browser automation library. Most often used for testing
web-applications, Selenium may be used for any task that requires automating
interaction with the browser.

## Installation

Install via npm with

    npm install browserstack-webdriver

## Usage

Below code is a sample test, which opens Google's homepage, searches for ‘browserstack’, and asks for the title of the search results page.

    var webdriver = require('browserstack-webdriver');
    
    // Input capabilities
    var capabilities = {
        'browserName' : 'firefox', 
        'browserstack.user' : BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME,
        'browserstack.key' : BROWSERSTACK_KEY
    }
    
    var driver = new webdriver.Builder().
      usingServer('http://hub.browserstack.com/wd/hub').
      withCapabilities(capabilities).
      build();
    
    driver.get('http://www.google.com/ncr');
    driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('q')).sendKeys('BrowserStack');
    driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('btnG')).click();
    
    driver.getTitle().then(function(title) {
        console.log(title);
    });
    
    driver.quit();

## Documentation

API documentation is included in the `docs` directory and is also available
online from the [Selenium project][api]. Addition resources include

- the #selenium channel on freenode IRC
- the [selenium-users@googlegroups.com][users] list
- [SeleniumHQ](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/) documentation

## Issues

Please report any issues using the [Selenium issue tracker][issues]. When using
the issue tracker

- __Do__ include a detailed description of the problem.
- __Do__ include a link to a [gist](http://gist.github.com/) with any
    interesting stack traces/logs (you may also attach these directly to the bug
    report).
- __Do__ include a [reduced test case][reduction]. Reporting "unable to find
    element on the page" is _not_ a valid report - there's nothing for us to
    look into. Expect your bug report to be closed if you do not provide enough
    information for us to investigate.
- __Do not__ use the issue tracker to submit basic help requests. All help
    inquiries should be directed to the [user forum][users] or #selenium IRC
    channel.
- __Do not__ post empty "I see this too" or "Any updates?" comments. These
    provide no additional information and clutter the log.
- __Do not__ report regressions on closed bugs as they are not actively
    monitored for upates (especially bugs that are >6 months old). Please open a
    new issue and reference the original bug in your report.
